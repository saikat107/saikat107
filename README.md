# ðŸ‘‹ About me
Hi, I am Saikat, currently a Senior Researcher at the 
[Research in Software Engineering (RiSE) group at Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/research-software-engineering-rise/). 
Earlier, I graduated with Ph.D. in omputer Science from [Columbia University in the City of New York](https://cs.columbia.edu) advised by 
[Professor Baishakhi Ray](rayb.info). I wrote my Ph.D. thesis on [Learning to Edit Code](http://saikatc.info/pdfs/Thesis.pdf).

# ðŸ‘€ My Interest
Iâ€™m interested in  Artificial Intelligence for Software Engineering (AI4SE). 
My research passion is Programming Language Processing (PLP) -- A coalescence between Software Engineering and Machine Learning. 
More specifically, I am motivated by building tools and techniques that reduces software engineering practitioners' burden by 
automating tasks they have to undergo in their everyday job. Over the years, I have been building developer assistance tools 
with research collaboration across Software Engineering, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing.

# :open_hands: My Goal
### **:innocent: Learning:** 
  *  Formal Properties of Programming Languages, Program Synthesis, Specification Mining, Verification, and Testing. 
### **:wave: Looking for Collaboration:** 
  * Use of Artificial Intelligence and/or Machine (Deep) Learning for software engineering tasks. 
  * Use of Large Language Models for Program Synthesis/Editing
